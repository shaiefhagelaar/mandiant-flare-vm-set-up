# Legal Disclaimer and Terms of Use

**Subject:** FLARE-VM Malware Analysis Environment
**Platform:** VMware Workstation (Type-2 Hypervisor)
**Guest Operating System:** Microsoft Windows 11 (installed from official ISO)
**Date:** _______________
**Prepared by:** _______________

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This virtual machine is configured with FLARE-VM, a malware analysis and reverse-engineering distribution maintained by Mandiant (a Google company). It is built and used **solely for lawful, educational, and authorized security research purposes**, including malware analysis, reverse engineering, detection engineering, and the study of attacker tradecraft within a controlled laboratory environment.

This environment is **not** intended for, and shall not be used for, the development, distribution, or deployment of malicious software against any system, network, or party without explicit prior authorization.

## 2. Authorized Use Only

The operator agrees to use this environment only:

1. On hardware and infrastructure they own or are explicitly authorized to use;
2. To analyze software samples they are legally permitted to possess and examine;
3. In compliance with all applicable local, national, and international laws, as well as any relevant institutional, academic, or organizational policies.

Any unauthorized access, distribution of malware, or use against third-party systems is strictly prohibited and is the sole responsibility of the operator.

## 3. Isolation and Containment

This system is intended to be operated as an **isolated, disposable analysis sandbox**. The operator is responsible for implementing appropriate containment controls, which may include but are not limited to:

- Disabling shared folders, shared clipboard, and drag-and-drop between host and guest;
- Configuring host-only or fully disconnected networking when handling live samples;
- Using non-persistent disks or VM snapshots to enable safe rollback;
- Preventing any analyzed sample from accessing the host system, production networks, or the internet unless explicitly required and controlled.

The operator acknowledges that malware samples are inherently dangerous and that improper containment may result in infection of the host, connected systems, or networks.

## 4. Third-Party Software and Licensing

FLARE-VM automates the installation of numerous third-party tools, packages, and utilities, each governed by its own respective license (open-source, freeware, or commercial). FLARE-VM itself is distributed under its applicable open-source license by Mandiant.

The operator is solely responsible for:

1. Reviewing and complying with the license terms of FLARE-VM and every tool it installs;
2. Ensuring any commercial or restricted-license tools are properly licensed before use;
3. Respecting all usage restrictions imposed by the respective software vendors.

No endorsement, affiliation, or sponsorship by Mandiant, Google, Microsoft, VMware (Broadcom), or any tool author is implied by this installation.

## 5. Microsoft Windows 11 Licensing

The Windows 11 guest operating system is installed from an official Microsoft ISO and is subject to the **Microsoft Software License Terms / End User License Agreement (EULA)**. The operator is responsible for ensuring that a valid Windows license is held for this installation, or that the installation is used strictly within the bounds permitted by Microsoft for evaluation or development purposes.

This document does not grant any license to Microsoft software, and the operator assumes full responsibility for compliance with all applicable Microsoft licensing terms.

## 6. VMware / Broadcom Software

VMware Workstation is used in accordance with its applicable license terms (commercial, personal-use, or otherwise as provided by Broadcom). The operator is responsible for holding a valid license for the hypervisor where required.

## 7. No Warranty

This environment and its configuration are provided **"as is" and "as available," without warranty of any kind**, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, or non-infringement. No guarantee is made regarding the stability, security, or completeness of the environment.

## 8. Assumption of Risk and Limitation of Liability

The operator assumes **all risk** arising from the installation, configuration, and use of this environment, including the handling of malicious software. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither the author of this document nor any referenced project, vendor, or third party shall be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or other damages — including data loss, system compromise, malware escape, hardware damage, or legal consequences — resulting from the use or misuse of this environment.

## 9. Acknowledgment

By installing, configuring, or operating this environment, the operator confirms that they have read, understood, and agreed to the terms set out in this disclaimer, and that they will conduct all activities lawfully, ethically, and within the scope of their authorization.
